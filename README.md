[Self-Project] Hearthstone TCG

Was tired of waiting to get into the closed-beta of Hearthstone so decided to attempt to create a version the game myself.  This project ended due to class projects, but it was fun trying to implement the knowledge I learned in class to accomplish my own task.

This project represents the knowledge of Java I knew my sophomore year.
